# Lectures

A collection of lecture files for any and all classes I work on. Organized into folders based on which class the lectures are for.

## Autogeneration

Lecture slides are generated by pandoc using the tex/beamer interface. Loaded from Markdown, they can be configured to be generated by the following command on every save.

1. Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get install pandoc
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended
sudo apt install texlive-pictures
```
2. Install the "run on save" extension from "emeraldwalk"
3. Add the following configuration to the settings.json file:
```json
"emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
    "commands": [
        {
            "match": "\\-slides.md",
            "isAsync": true,
            "cmd": "pandoc -t beamer --slide-level=2 ${file} -o ${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExt}.pdf"
        }
    ]
}
```
4. Name any lecture files as desired and append the suffix "-slides.md" to the filename
5. Save the files and have pdfs automatically generated
