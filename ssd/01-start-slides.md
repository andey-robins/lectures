# Cybersecurity: Secure Software Design

## Course Aims

*The aim of this course:* provide students with an understanding of the software design lifecycle, cybersecurity, and most importantly, the overlap between the two. Students will get hands on experience designing, writing, and maintaining applications with security included as an integral component.

## Outline

- Syllabus & Housekeeping
- Software Design History
- Security Design Motivation

## Disclaimer

In this course, you will learn the techniques and processes employed by skillful attackers. We learn this for the explicit purpose of developing more secure systems and subverting potential attacks. We discuss the situations and boundaries of ethical security practice in this course and you are held to this high standard. **Do not attack any system or information without explicit prior written permission.** Not only is it a really bad idea, itâ€™s probably illegal and a violation of UWYO network rules (UW Regulation 8-1) and the CEPS technology policy. I am not responsible for any actions you perform.

## Meeting Times

**Class:** MWF 8-8:50 am

**Office Hours:** M 11-12 & MR 1-2 & By Appointment

**Office:** EERB 228 (SSC Lab)

# The Early Days

## The Antikythera Mechanism

- The antikythera mechanism (circa 200 BCE)

## Babbage's Analytical Engine

- Babbage Analytical Engine (1837)

## Ada Lovelace

- The first programmer (1842)

---

*"[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent."* - Ada of Lovelace

## The First Computed Algorithm

- Tom Kilburn
- the greatest divisor of 2^18 (262,144)
- 58 minutes to run

---

```python
print("Calculating the greatest divisor of 2^18")
n = 2 ** 18

for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5)+1):
  if n % i == 0:
    print(f'The greatest divisor is {int(n / i)}')
    print(f'{n} / {int(n/i)} = {i}')
    return
```

## The Transistor

## First Compilers

- development of "programming" with first compilers and cobol/fortran

## COBOL

## Waterfall Design

- waterfall development (1970)

## C

- introduction of c (1972)

## The Apple II

- apple II and the beginning of personal computing
  - led to the creation of software development

# The Era of Personal Computing

## DRM introduced (1983)

## Word & Excel (mid 80s)

## Ping-Pong Virus & Cyberaids (1988)

## Therac-25

- Likely the first time a human died because of code issues
- Radiation therapy machine
- Delivered lethal doses of radiation to patients due to race conditions in the code

# Web 1.0

## The Internet (1991)

## Linux Kernel (1991)

## Design Patterns (GoF) (1994)

## Citibank Hack (1995)

## Php (1995)

## Java (1996)

## Mobile Devices
  
- First PDAs emerge in 1996
- Similar to the Apple II, led to the need for consumer software
- Began a process which is slowly replacing traditional computers

# The Dot Com Crash

## SaaS (1999)

- Salesforce launches their customer relationship management platform
- First instance of Software as a Service
- Changed the profit model for software businesses to this day

## ILOVEYOU (2000)

## mafiaboy (2000)

## US vs Microsoft (2001)

## agile (2001)

## Gary McKinnon and Military hacking (2001-2002)

## AWS (2002)

  }, nil
}

"""
The attacker used several networks to spoof 167 Mpps (millions of packets per second) to 180,000 exposed CLDAP, DNS, and SMTP servers, which would then send large responses to us. This demonstrates the volumes a well-resourced attacker can achieve: This was four times larger than the record-breaking 623 Gbps attack from the Mirai botnet a year earlier.
