# Cybersecurity: Secure Software Design

## Course Aims

*The aim of this course:* provide students with an understanding of the software design lifecycle, cybersecurity, and most importantly, the overlap between the two. Students will get hands on experience designing, writing, and maintaining applications with security included as an integral component.

## Outline

- Syllabus & Housekeeping
- Software Design History
- Security Design Motivation

## Disclaimer

In this course, you will learn the techniques and processes employed by skillful attackers. We learn this for the explicit purpose of developing more secure systems and subverting potential attacks. We discuss the situations and boundaries of ethical security practice in this course and you are held to this high standard. **Do not attack any system or information without explicit prior written permission.** Not only is it a really bad idea, itâ€™s probably illegal and a violation of UWYO network rules (UW Regulation 8-1) and the CEPS technology policy. I am not responsible for any actions you perform.

## Meeting Times

**Class:** MWF 8-8:50 am

**Office Hours:** M 11-12 & MR 1-2 & By Appointment

**Office:** EERB 228 (SSC Lab)

# The History of Software Engineering

---

What follows is a very abridged, loosly structured, highly opinionated view of the history of software engineering. I ask you to pay attention to trends and common themes more than any individual contribution. History is a series of movements, not individual, revolutionary steps. Here be dragons.

## Outline

1. The Early Days (200 BCE - 1980s)
2. The Era of Personal Computing (1983 - 1990)
3. Web 1.0 (1991 - 1999)
4. The Dot Com Crash (2000 - 2005)
5. The Agile Age (2006 - 2009)
6. The Microservice Era (2010 - 2014)
7. The Emerging Serverless Era (2015 - Present)

# The Early Days

## The Antikythera Mechanism

- The oldest analogue computer
- Used to calculate astornomical positions and eclipses

---

![The Antikythera Mechanism](./ssd/assets/01/antikythera.jpg)

## Babbage's Analytical Engine

- Credited as the first computer
- Has an ALU, control flow, loops, and memory
- First turing complete computer

---

![The Analytic Engine](./ssd/assets/01/babbage.jpg)

## Ada Lovelace

- Augusta King (1815 - 1852)
  - Countess of Lovelace, Augusta Ada King
  - AKA Ada Lovelace
- Published the first algorithm to be run by a computer
- Made to run on Babbage's Analytical Engine

---

*"[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent."* - Ada of Lovelace

## The First Computed Algorithm

- Tom Kilburn
- First implemented program calculates the greatest divisor of 2^18 (262,144)
- Took 58 minutes to run

---

```python
print("Calculating the greatest divisor of 2^18")
n = 2 ** 18

for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5)+1):
  if n % i == 0:
    print(f'The greatest divisor is {int(n / i)}')
    print(f'{n} / {int(n/i)} = {i}')
    return
```

--- 

![Timing of greatest divisor on a desktop computer](./ssd/assets/01/gcd_speed.png)

## The Transistor

- Came to replace vacuum tubes
- Is the reason computers are reasonable sizes
- Led to the computer being a consumer product

## First Compilers

- Plugging wires around and moving switches is hard, wouldn't it be nice if we had a program that could handle putting the program into the computer on its own?

## COBOL

- There's a whole bunch of ways to program computers, wouldn't it be nice if there was some sort of coordinated logic for doing that?

## Waterfall Design (1970)

- Formalizes the code writing process
- Creates a step by step process to create software
- One of the first industry standard processes

---

![Waterfall design pattern](./ssd/assets/01/Waterfall_model.png)

## C (1972)

- Major standard
- Still around today
- Made interfacing with hardware more general and straightforward

## Aside: C vs Rust

- "The last fifty years were written in C. The next fifty will be written in Rust"
- `NULL` was a "billion dollar mistake"
- NSA recommends businesses stop writing new software in C and instead use a memory safe language

## The Apple II (1977)

- Began the wave of personal computing
- One of the first mass produced computers
- Affordable enough for home usage
- Led to the need for rigorous, deployable, software engineering

# The Era of Personal Computing

## DRM introduced (1983)

- Digital Rights Management
- The idea that intellectual property distributed digitally should be protected
- Gave rise to the cracking and piracy communities
- Valid and Questionable applications even to this day
  - Further complicated by the lack of "ownership" of digital goods

## Word & Excel (mid 80s)

- Some of the earliest "killer apps" for computers
- Proved the usefulness of computers within business contexts
- Proprietary and licensed

## Ping-Pong Virus & Cyberaids (1988)

- Overwrites, moves, and modifies random files before sending itself to as many people in the address book as possible
- One of the earliest email viruses

## Agile (2001)

While the waterfall design methodology had its place, the needs of SaaS businesses require being able to adapt software to business needs faster than the methodology allows. Enter "Agile" methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc.) which completely change the way software is designed, written, produced, and maintained.

## Gary McKinnon and Military hacking (2001-2002)

- Lambda, EC2, S3, Dynamo, etc.

## Making Money as a Tech Business

- Large amounts of capital combined with a new, emerging technology led to unwise investments
- Company must balloon quickly and gain a lions-share of users/marketshare
- Convert this dominance to sales
- Without a plan to become profitable, investors lose faith
- The money dries up
- The company is either Facebook or Myspace

## Dot Com Bubble

- The start of the internet led to unknowns surrounding businesses operating in the space
- Low interest rates at the end of the '80s and early '90s meant lots of VC funding
- Any old idea could get pitched as investors wanted to get into the space

---

- Wouldn't it be nice if there was a tool which allows us to interact with the DOM?

*"Anonymous is tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the peopleâ€™s rights to spread information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause; yet they do no such thing. In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. Anonymous will not stand this any longer."* - Anonymous

## First iPhone (2007)

- Did for mobile computing what the Apple ][ did for home computing
- Put a computer in everyone's pocket
- Increased "software engineering" to include mobile applications
- Drove the need for meshnets across the world

- When they work, it's almost like magic
- When they don't, it's often nearly impossible to figure out why
- Work well for massive organizations where engineering teams aren't able to directly communicate all the time
- Rely on rigorous design documents

## Electron (2013) 

- Writing native applications is hard
- Wouldn't it be nice to just release your webpage as an app?
- Electron is chromium bound to a single application
- Now everything can be web development :) 

## Docker (2013)

---

```go
func Handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) 
    (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {

	name := request.PathParameters["name"]
	message := fmt.Sprintf(
    " { \"Message\" : \"Hello %s \" } ", name
  )

	return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
    Body: message, StatusCode: 200
  }, nil
}
```

## Equifax breach (2017)

- 147.8 million private identifying records were exfiltrated
  - Terrabytes of data
- Settlement worth $425 million paid out by Equifax

## How did it happen?

1. Entry through a consumer complaint portal using a known, but unpatched vulnerability
2. Moved to "secure" servers due to lack of segmentation
3. Unrenewed certificate on Equifax's end let them exfiltrated encrypted data for months
4. Executives started dumping shares and the breach wasn't publicized for more than a month after discovery

  - "no customer data was accessed"
  - Later announced source code and technical information were stolen
- Later, customer "vaults" were extracted
  - "a proprietary binary format that contains both unencrypted data...as well as fully-encrypted sensitive fields"
- Lastpass recommends no updates at this time
- Security Professionals recommend changing all passwords in Lastpass, enabling 2FA anywhere its available, and migrating to a different password manager

## SvelteKit (2022)

- Web framework
- Handles all the major things like auth, routing, distribution, compilation, bundling, etc.
- Major competitor is Next.js, time will tell which becomes the most common

# Major Trends

## Problems in Software Design

1. Create a product that people have a need for
2. Create a product that is able to live on
3. Create a product that protects the people involved with it

## We can make a tool for that!

- When we encounter a problem, it's common for out solution to be, let's build a tool to do that
- This mirrors the abstraction that comes so naturally to software engineers
- Abstracting out lower layers leads to multiple assumptions

## Assumptions:

1. Everything works as it's intended to
2. Security issues at lower levels are handled
3. We can operate without an explicit understanding of lower layers

## Fact:

1. ~~Everything works as it's intended to~~
2. ~~Security issues at lower levels are handled~~
3. ~~We can operate without an explicit understanding of lower layers~~

## Abstraction

Even the concept of a computer undergoes abstraction in our model.

Room sized computing devices -> mainframes -> computers -> servers -> IaaS -> SaaS -> FaaS

# Why Design in Security

## Major Threats

- APTs
- Crackers & Piracy
- Breaches
- Modern DDoS
  - Azure DDoS of 3.47 Tbps for 15 mins ~3 Petabytes of data ($63k alone just to store)

---

*"The attacker used several networks to spoof 167 Mpps (millions of packets per second) to 180,000 exposed CLDAP, DNS, and SMTP servers, which would then send large responses to us. This demonstrates the volumes a well-resourced attacker can achieve: This was four times larger than the record-breaking 623 Gbps attack from the Mirai botnet a year earlier."* - Google Press Release

---

*"In November [2021], Microsoft mitigated a DDoS attack with a throughput of 3.47 Tbps and a packet rate of 340 million packets per second (pps), targeting an Azure customer in Asia. We believe this to be the largest attack ever reported in history.*

*"This was a distributed attack originating from approximately 10,000 sources and from multiple countries across the globe, including the United States, China, South Korea, Russia, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Iran, Indonesia, and Taiwan. Attack vectors were UDP reflection on port 80 using Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Network Time Protocol (NTP) comprising one single peak, and the overall attack lasted approximately 15 minutes."* - Azure Press Release

---

1. Attackers are getting more and more capable
2. Increasing numbers of people are conducting increasingly important tasks online
3. Malicious actors are incentivized to get in
4. It only takes one exploit to invalidate any one security
