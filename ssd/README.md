# Secure Software Design

**Taught:** Spring 2023
**Listed:** COSC 4010/5010 - Cybersecurity: Secure Software Design

Secure Software Design straddles the line between a software design and a cybersecurity course. Students develop an understanding and build experience in writing and maintaining applications with security baked in from the beginning. This course made use of the book *Designing Secure Software* by Loren Kohnfelder.
