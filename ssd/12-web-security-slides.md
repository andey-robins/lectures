Prepare yourself for acronym hell.

## Web Basics

- HTML/CSS/JS/JSON
- Client/server model
- Cookies, Certs, and Authorities
- DOM
- Frameworks
- HTTP/REST/RPC

## Foundational Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (and TypeScript)
- JSON (or XML and others)

## HTML

**Hyper Text Markup Language:** an encoding schema for expressing the content on a web page as hyper text.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>I must not fear, fear is the mind killer...</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## CSS

**Cascading Style Sheets:** a means to express the styling of individual objects or classes of objects in the DOM.

```css
app {
  background-color: #000;
  color: #fff;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    font-family: 'courier';
}
```

## JavaScript

**Javascript:** is a lightweight, interpreted, JIT compiled, functional programming language. It is used on the server side of 98% of websites today.

```js
let fooElement = document.getElementById('foo');

fooElement.textContent = 'New text content';
```

## Aside: The History of JS

Back in the Netscape days of the internet, Brendan Eich was brought in to embed Scheme into the next Netscape browser. Instead, they believed it was the correct move to develop a new language just for the web. Brendan then took 10 days, and the early versions of JS are the result.

## TypeScript

**TypeScript:** A superset of JS which adds type-checking, interfaces, and classes to vanilla JS. Developed and released by Microsoft and Anders Hejlsberg, it's used very often in frontend JS applications making use of libraries.

```ts
let fooElement: Element = document.getElementById('foo');

let fooElement.textContent: string = 'New text content';
```

## JSON

**Javscript Object Notation:** A common means of representing and exchanging information across the internet. It fits very nicely into javascript due to adopting the JS style of modeling data.

```json
{
    name: "Andey Robins",
    age: 22,
    job: {
        title: "Graduate Research Assistant",
    }
}
```

## Client Server Models

The **Client/Server Model** of design designates two locations for logic and a many-to-one* relationship between them. Computation can be performed at either point in the system, but a strict trust boundary exists between the two.

## Static Pages

The simplest setup is a static site (i.e. every user receives the same content). Here the server is said to "serve" the content to the client. A complete HTML document (or whatever) is handed off through HTTP.

## Dynamic Pages

Dynamic pages are resources that look different for each visitor. There are two main approaches to delivering dynamic content, placing the burden of rendering on either the client or server.

## CSR

_"Client-side rendering(CSR) involves rendering pages directly in the browser using JavaScript. All logic, data retrieval, templating, and routing are handled on the client, not on the server."_ - Scythe Studio

## CSR Page

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title> CSR App </title>
  </head>
 
  <body>
    <div id="app"> </div>
    <script src="../src/index.js"> </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## SSR

_"Server-side rendering (SSR) is an applicationâ€™s ability to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client. The web browser submits a request for information from the server, which instantly responds by sending a fully rendered page to the client. Whenever the client navigates to a different page on the website, the server will do the work once more."_ - Scythe Studio

## SSR Page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <title> Web Page Rendered on Server Side </title>
 </head>
<body>
  <h1> This is a Heading   </h1>
  <div> 
    <p> This is a form </p>
      <form>
        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
      </form>
  <div>
</body>
</html>
```

## CSR vs SSR

Server Load -> **CSR**

SEO -> **SSR**

Interactivity -> **CSR**

Intial Load Time -> **SSR**

SPA/SaaS Style App -> **CSR**

Content Heavy -> **SSR**

## CSR and SSR Security

- Who is making the requests?
- Where is the data located?
- What is an expected UX?

## The DOM

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is _the_ datastructure for the web. It represents a page as a collection of objects, which can be created, modified, or deleted programatically by the documents which make up the page and the JS runtime.

## Top Frameworks

- Next.js/Sveltekit
- Nuxt.js/Svelte
- Express
- React/Angular/Vue

## Batteries Included 

- These have everything you need in one system
- Often opinionated
- Minimal transferability

Ex: Next.js, Sveltekit, Gatsby, etc.

## Batteries Not Included

- Just components
- Do one thing and do it well
- Can often be embedded in other applications

Ex: React, Svelte, Vue, Angular, etc.

## Aside: Runtimes

As for backend runtimes, there are several in the JS world right now. They are ranked in order of importance/prevalence.

1. Node
2. Deno
3. Bun

## Communication Protocols

These are the potential ways to send and request information over the web.

## HTTP

- Basic
- Verb driven
- Infinitely configurable
- No model baked in

## REST

**Representational State Transfer:** is an approach to API design which removes all need for maintaining state from the web-server.

A primary benefit is that it is client agnostic, allowing for arbitrary client stacks (i.e. Web and Mobile and Desktop through the same API)

## HTTP vs REST

HTTP may or may not have some concept of state. If it does, it isn't RESTful. If it doesn't, it's a REST API.

## CRUD

- **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete
- Maps to HTTP Verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Good for data-first applications
- Built on top of HTTP

## RPC

**Remote Procedure Call** is a computational methodology where almost all of the processing is done on the server. Modern versions use Protobuffs and HTTP 2 as well to make them incredibly quick with throughput.

# Web Security

## Security Objects

While we'll talk more about security in the web, it's important to provide some discussion surrounding the common, security primitives that we use in the web.

- Cookies
- Certificates
- CAs

## Cookies

**Cookies** are small pieces of data which a server asks the client to store and provide on subsequent requests made to the server. 

## An Analogy

I'm a baker, and I want to keep track of how many times someone visits my bakery. If it's their first time I give them a slip of paper with the number 1 on it. Every time they come back in, I give them a new slip with their number plus 1.

It's then easy to see how often a customer visits by checking their slip of paper (their cookie).

## Session Cookies

**Session Cookies** are a special type of cookie which establish a secure session between a client and the server. It allows an individual client to be identified by the server and is usually backed by some cryptographic assurance of identity.

## Good Cookies

- Preferences
- Configurations/Settings
- "Front End Stuff"
- Identification
- Session Management

## Bad Cookies

- Trackers*
- Price
- Security Information

In other words, treat a cookie as a form of user input which is subject to all of the validation any user input is subject to.

## Cookie Interaction

A `<script>` has access to cookies by default unless they set the `httponly` attribute. Therefore, we can assume that cookies by default can be accessed by a malicious script, so why do we not just have `httponly` set by default?

## Cookie Interaction

A `<script>` has access to cookies by default unless they set the `httponly` attribute. Therefore, we can assume that cookies by default can be accessed by a malicious script, so why do we not just have `httponly` set by default?

**Backwards Compatibility**

## Certificate Authorities

**Certificate Authorities** are groups which are largely granted trust and who we trust to sign the certificates and authorize/authenticate other principles in the net. 

Ex: Digicert, Let's Encrypt, Google Trust Services, etc.

## Certificates

**Certificates** are the digital artifacts produced by Certificate Authorities. It's basically just like any form of ID, but backed by a cryptographic identity.

![Example Certificates for Google Images](./ssd/assets/12/certs.png)

## HTTP vs HTTPS

**HTTPS** is just HTTP over TLS/SSL. It addresses threats by:

1. Encrypting traffic in flight
2. Prevent modification in the middle
3. Verify communicator identities

## Adoption 

- Developed in 1994
- Facebook used HTTP up until 2013
- General hardware good enough as of 2015
- 40% of the web in HTTPS in 2016
- 85% as of 2020

## Why the Delay?

1. Hardware speeds
2. Crypto bugs
3. Lack of CAs (price wise)
4. No consumer demand

## Same Origin Policy

You don't want a single website to be able to open up and modifying your accounts on other pages [citation needed].

The "Same Origin Policy" is the idea that other pages (or origins) should not be able to _reach in_ to a page's content.

## CORS

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** is the mechanism to circumvent the Same Origin Policy. Established through headers and enforced by the browser, this places restrictions on which domains are allowed to send information to other domains. This is a common problem to run into while developing web apps locally, and slightly beyond the scope of what we have time to talk about.

## Visible Information: Cookies

Can the webpage served by the host see the cookies set for other hosts?

|Host|ex.com|dog.ex.com|cat.ex.com|ex.org|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ex.com|Yes|No|No|No|
|dog.ex.com|Yes|Yes|No|No|
|cat.ex.com|Yes|No|Yes|No|
|ex.org|No|No|No|Yes|


## Visible Information: HTTP

|Can an attacker...|HTTP|HTTPS|
|---|---|---|
|see web traffic between endpoints?|Yes|Yes|
|see both IP addresses?|Yes|Yes|
|deduce the web server's identity?|Yes|Sometimes|
|see what page within the site is requested?|Yes|No|
|see the page content and the body of POSTs?|Yes|No|
|see the headers and URL?|Yes|No|
|tamper with the URL, headers, or content?|Yes|No|
