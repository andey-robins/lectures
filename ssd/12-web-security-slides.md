# Web Security

## Outline

- Web basics
- Web security
- Web vulnerabilities
- DevOps

Prepare yourself for acronym hell.

## Web Basics

- HTML/CSS/JS/JSON
- Client/server model
- Cookies, Certs, and Authorities
- DOM
- Frameworks
- HTTP/REST/RPC

## Foundational Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (and TypeScript)
- JSON (or XML and others)

## HTML

**Hyper Text Markup Language:** an encoding schema for expressing the content on a web page as hyper text.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>I must not fear, fear is the mind killer...</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## CSS

**Cascading Style Sheets:** a means to express the styling of individual objects or classes of objects in the DOM.

```css
app {
  background-color: #000;
  color: #fff;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    font-family: 'courier';
}
```

## JavaScript

**Javascript:** is a lightweight, interpreted, JIT compiled, functional programming language. It is used on the server side of 98% of websites today.

```js
let fooElement = document.getElementById('foo');

fooElement.textContent = 'New text content';
```

## Aside: The History of JS

Back in the Netscape days of the internet, Brendan Eich was brought in to embed Scheme into the next Netscape browser. Instead, they believed it was the correct move to develop a new language just for the web. Brendan then took 10 days, and the early versions of JS are the result.

## TypeScript

**TypeScript:** A superset of JS which adds type-checking, interfaces, and classes to vanilla JS. Developed and released by Microsoft and Anders Hejlsberg, it's used very often in frontend JS applications making use of libraries.

```ts
let fooElement: Element = document.getElementById('foo');

let fooElement.textContent: string = 'New text content';
```

## JSON

**Javscript Object Notation:** A common means of representing and exchanging information across the internet. It fits very nicely into javascript due to adopting the JS style of modeling data.

```json
{
    name: "Andey Robins",
    age: 22,
    job: {
        title: "Graduate Research Assistant",
    }
}
```

## Client Server Models

The **Client/Server Model** of design designates two locations for logic and a many-to-one* relationship between them. Computation can be performed at either point in the system, but a strict trust boundary exists between the two.

## Static Pages

The simplest setup is a static site (i.e. every user receives the same content). Here the server is said to "serve" the content to the client. A complete HTML document (or whatever) is handed off through HTTP.

## Dynamic Pages

Dynamic pages are resources that look different for each visitor. There are two main approaches to delivering dynamic content, placing the burden of rendering on either the client or server.

## CSR

_"Client-side rendering(CSR) involves rendering pages directly in the browser using JavaScript. All logic, data retrieval, templating, and routing are handled on the client, not on the server."_ - Scythe Studio

## CSR Page

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title> CSR App </title>
  </head>
 
  <body>
    <div id="app"> </div>
    <script src="../src/index.js"> </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## SSR

_"Server-side rendering (SSR) is an applicationâ€™s ability to convert HTML files on the server into a fully rendered HTML page for the client. The web browser submits a request for information from the server, which instantly responds by sending a fully rendered page to the client. Whenever the client navigates to a different page on the website, the server will do the work once more."_ - Scythe Studio

## SSR Page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <title> Web Page Rendered on Server Side </title>
 </head>
<body>
  <h1> This is a Heading   </h1>
  <div> 
    <p> This is a form </p>
      <form>
        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
      </form>
  <div>
</body>
</html>
```

## CSR vs SSR

Server Load -> **CSR**

SEO -> **SSR**

Interactivity -> **CSR**

Intial Load Time -> **SSR**

SPA/SaaS Style App -> **CSR**

Content Heavy -> **SSR**

## CSR and SSR Security

- Who is making the requests?
- Where is the data located?
- What is an expected UX?

## The DOM

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is _the_ datastructure for the web. It represents a page as a collection of objects, which can be created, modified, or deleted programatically by the documents which make up the page and the JS runtime.

## Top Frameworks

- Next.js/Sveltekit
- Nuxt.js/Svelte
- Express
- React/Angular/Vue

## Batteries Included 

- These have everything you need in one system
- Often opinionated
- Minimal transferability

Ex: Next.js, Sveltekit, Gatsby, etc.

## Batteries Not Included

- Just components
- Do one thing and do it well
- Can often be embedded in other applications

Ex: React, Svelte, Vue, Angular, etc.

## Aside: Runtimes

As for backend runtimes, there are several in the JS world right now. They are ranked in order of importance/prevalence.

1. Node
2. Deno
3. Bun

## Communication Protocols

These are the potential ways to send and request information over the web.

## HTTP

- Basic
- Verb driven
- Infinitely configurable
- No model baked in

## REST

## CRUD

- **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete
- Maps to HTTP Verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Good for data-first applications
- Built on top of HTTP

## RPC

# Web Security

## Security Objects

While we'll talk more about security in the web, it's important to provide some discussion surrounding the common, security primitives that we use in the web.

- Cookies
- Certificates
- CAs

## Cookies

## Certificates

---

![Example Certificates for Google Images](./ssd/assets/12/certs.png)

## Certificate Authorities

## HTTP vs HTTPS

## CORS

## Cookies and Subdomains

# Web Vulnerabilities

## XSS

## XSRF

## Common Mitigation

## OWASP Top 10
